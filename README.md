# Boilerplate For Landing Pages

Quickly set up projects where need Webpack, and want to benefit
from Gulp automation, BrowserSync reloading, and Pug templates.

Tasks are managed in `gulp/tasks`.

Gulp builds assets to `dist/` which BrowserSync serves.

## Getting Started

```shell
$ npm install
```

## Getting Down To Business

```shell
$ gulp
```
